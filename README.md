## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**17493b/17493b** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an idea for a simple calculator web tool to help people highlight a small albeit highly misleading subset of digital communications, and quickly make sense of them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis and visualisation, front-end web development and UX design.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the tool above, plus many more ideas. I have little to no development background, so I need a lot of help from AI, and a team of experienced devs, analysts, social scientists and leaders with an aspiration to build something truly game-changing from ground up.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating the future of DEHI - decentralised human intelligence, critical to counterbalance the rise of AI.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the shifting of the future of the very social contract, in terms of accountability - and the critical necessity to hold ourselves immutably and irrevocably accountable in the digital age.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 17493b@protonmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a real boy, I am creative director / ex-graphic visual designer. I love data, visualisation of data and I think it holds the keys to a future of both AI and HI together. Or more specifically i'm coining, DEHI - decentralised human intelligence. I was recently told by marine biologists that by far the largest bottleneck in science right now is data science, analysis and visualisation (communication), such is the rate of data generation that were we able to simply process and understand it all, we almost certainly would have incredible breakthroughs already hidden in the data.

--> Hello, look forward to working with you, World.
